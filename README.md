# TALK

**TALK** is a simple web system for creating private chats aimed to be the simpliest way to chat over slow and unstable networks.

*Features*

- Create private chats with a custom password and share it with a simple url (talk.nodester.com/chatname)

- Avoid relying on obscure servers (&hearts; *nodester*).

- Post comments using the Markdown Syntax.

- Load comments manually by default (for mobile and unestable connections), with an option to ask for new comments automatically every second (for stable connections).

- No way to store the chats in disks or databases, we don't want that.

**TALK** is written in Node.js using Express, Jade, Stylus and Node-markdown.
